Project Motivation.

For this project I used Stack Overflow Developer Survery data field for years 2018, 2019 and 2020. Responders to this surveys were recruited through channels owned by Stack Overflow, thus highly engaged users were more likley to get link for the survey.  These datasets helped me answered following questions:

      1. Does job satisfaction for coders differ between Europe and USA?
      2. Is the difference statisically significant?
      3. How does job statisfaction compare between years 2018, 2019 and 2020 in both continents?
      4. Which are top factors Stack Overflow users would consider when deciding between two job offers?
      5. How do these factors differ between genders?
