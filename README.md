## Project Description

In this project I wanted to first understand if European developers are more satisfied with their job compared to their USA colleagues. Secondly, I was interested in analyzing the factors developers living in the happiest countries consider between two equal job offers. To answer these questions, I used Stack Overflow Developer Survey data for years 2018, 2019 and 2020. Responders to these surveys were recruited through channels owned by Stack Overflow, thus highly engaged users were more likely to get link for the survey. These datasets helped me answered following questions:

      1. Does job satisfaction for coders differ between Europe and USA?
      2. Is the difference statistically significant?
      3. How does job satisfaction compare between years 2018, 2019 and 2020 in  these locations?
      4. Which are top factors Stack Overflow coders located in the happiest places in the world 
         consider when deciding between two job offers?
      5. How do these factors differ between genders? 


## File Description

Above analysis has been performed in a single notebook under name: data_exploration.ipynb following CRISP-DM process. Comments and markdowns have been used to explain the code and separate the sections.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found in the post available [here](https://medium.com/@_Florida/bits-of-insights-from-developers-living-in-worlds-happiest-countries-1d2e43798b5d).
